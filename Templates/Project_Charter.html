<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to create an intuitive, interactive dashboard/interface using Flask that incorporates key project management elements. These include a project charter, work breakdown structure (WBS), statements of work (SOW), Gantt chart with a working calendar, project network diagram, critical path analysis, cost estimates, team-building exercises, and templates for status/progress reports and risk management plans. The goal is to support effective project management through accessible and user-friendly web-based tools.</p>
